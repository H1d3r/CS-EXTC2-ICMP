# ICMP_POC

#### Todo:

 - [X] POC bridge
    - [ ] Chunk Handling (ex, max msg size of 32 bytes, how to handle when bigger.)
        Controller side, maybe create a class that holds each communiciation + gets chunks, if seen before, access class, if not, new class?

 - [ ] Update readme to have docs/easy to read "how this works"
 - [ ] CS Integration:
    - [ ] Controller
    - [ ] Client:
        Pull & execute payloads
